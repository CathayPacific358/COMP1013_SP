Run the program in Task 1. And write your answer blow each of the following questions.

1.	What is this program supposed to do?

	The programme receieve inputs of name, id and gender and 


2.	Is the memory dynamically allocated or statically allocated

	Because malloc() and free() are used, the memory is dynamically allocated


3.	What  is %*c used for?

	%*c is used to read and ignore a character, which particularly in this case used to ignore a space next to the id number. (Because people input like : ECWU 123 girl, 	which contains a space between id and gender.)


4.	If %-10s is changed to %10s, what happened?

	If changed to %10s, the name will be align to right


5.	Why do we need to add free(p)?

	Because after malloc() a block of memory of specified size will be allocated, and when we finished the function, we need to use free() to release the used memory.

//CODE HERE
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
struct stuRec{
  char name[20];
  int id; 
  char gender;
};

int main()
{
struct stuRec *p;
p = (struct stuRec*)malloc(sizeof(struct stuRec));
if (p){
printf("please input name, id and gender\n");
scanf("%s%d%*c%c", p->name, &p->id, &p->gender);
printf("name:%-10s,ID:%d,gender:%c\n", p->name,p->id,p->gender);
free (p);
}
return 0;
}
